## Design and Ideas
    We set out with the goal of creating an interactive gaming experience.
    
    It's designed to entice the customer with a flashy, addictive game that keeps the customer coming back for more. It uses many tropes of modern eye catching games, such as flashy, bright colors and high stakes challenges.

    A modern take on a classic game, Cryptoad was inspired by games like frogger and crossy road. With a twist. The game implements a betting and gambling system, where the user can place bets using in store currency. As they progress further into the level, the multiplier of their bet increases, leaving them with more in store currency to spend. However, as the game progresses, it becomes increasingly impossible. 
    
    More functionality coming soon because of time constraints.
